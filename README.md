# Confidence-Aware-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-for-Cybersecurity

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **research project** exploring the integration of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with Large Language Models (LLMs) for cybersecurity applications.  
Unlike static models, RAG pipelines enhance adaptability by retrieving **up-to-date external knowledge**, improving detection and response to evolving cyber threats.  
A central feature of this work is **uncertainty-aware evaluation**, using **entropy and similarity-based scoring** to determine when the model is confident versus when it must seek additional context.

## Research Objectives
- Develop a **retrieval-augmented LLM pipeline** for analyzing and responding to cyber threat intelligence.  
- Use **CISCO Talos vulnerability reports** as trusted external knowledge sources for retrieval.  
- Measure **response confidence** with entropy-based uncertainty metrics.  
- Compare **RAG vs. Non-RAG performance**, using **ChatGPT responses as a baseline** for evaluation.  
- Demonstrate how adaptive AI agents can **refine responses by retrieving additional context** when uncertainty is high.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Scraped vulnerability reports and cyber threat data from **CISCO Talos Intelligence Group** using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`.  
   - Cleaned and chunked text, then converted into **vector embeddings**.  
   - Stored embeddings in a **FAISS vector database**.  

2. **RAG Question Answering**  
   - Input: user query.  
   - Retrieved **top-k relevant chunks** using **cosine similarity**.  
   - Passed chunks as context to LLMs (Gemma, LLaMA).  
   - Compared generated answers against **ChatGPT outputs** as a baseline.  

3. **Evaluation & Confidence Scoring**  
   - Semantic similarity metric used for correctness evaluation.  
   - If similarity < threshold, pipeline retrieved **more context** and regenerated response.  
   - Confidence assessed with **entropy scores**: lower entropy = higher confidence.

##  Future/Ongoing Work
- **Model-Specific Fine-Tuning**  
  Tailor RAG pipelines to different LLMs for maximum benefit.  

- **Uncertainty-Aware Agents**  
  Expand the entropy-driven mechanism into **full agent feedback loops**, where the system decides whether to query new data sources.  

- **Broader Cybersecurity Applications**  
  Extend the framework to phishing detection, intrusion analysis, and malware classification.
